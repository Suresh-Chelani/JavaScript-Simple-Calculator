## Responsive JavaScript Calculator

Descriptions for its functionality:

## HTML Structure:
- The HTML file defines the structure of a simple calculator web page.
- It includes a `<head>` section with metadata, a title, links to external stylesheets and favicon.
- The `<body>` section contains a calculator interface with buttons for digits, operators, and other functionalities.
- It also includes a header (`<h1>`) with the text "Calculate Me!" and a footer indicating that it was made by Suresh.

## CSS Styles (`style.css`):
- The CSS file defines styling for the calculator and implements a dark mode feature.
- It sets variable values for primary and secondary colors, button colors, display background, and more.
- Styles are defined for the body, calculator container, input display, buttons, and media queries for responsiveness.
- The dark theme is activated by the class `dark-theam` which changes color variables and adjusts the appearance.

## JavaScript Logic (`script.js`):
- The JavaScript file handles the logic of the calculator.
- It initializes an empty expression string and selects all buttons with the class `button`.
- Event listeners are added to the buttons to update the expression based on user input.
- The `eval` function is used to evaluate the expression when the '=' button is clicked.
- The AC button clears the expression, and the DEL button removes the last character.
- The dark mode is implemented by toggling the class `dark-theam` on the body, and the toggle button's appearance is adjusted accordingly.

## Dark and Light Mode Toggle (`script.js`):
- The dark and light mode functionality is achieved using a slider button with the class `toggle`.
- The function `mcMover` is called when the slider is clicked, toggling the `dark-theam` class on the body.
- The slider's position is animated, and its background color changes to indicate the current mode.

## Responsiveness:
- The styles include media queries to make the calculator responsive on different screen sizes.
- Adjustments are made for smaller screens by changing the width of the calculator box, button width, and input width.

General Notes:
- The calculator has a clean and visually appealing design.
- The dark mode feature provides a different color scheme for users who prefer a darker interface.
- The code is well-organized and follows best practices.
- Responsiveness is addressed through media queries, making the calculator usable on various devices.

In summary, the code implements a functional and aesthetically pleasing calculator with additional features like dark mode and responsiveness for a better user experience.
